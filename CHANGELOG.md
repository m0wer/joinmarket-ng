# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Early backend connection validation in taker CLI before wallet sync.
- Estimated transaction fee logging before user confirmation prompt (assumes 1 input per maker + 20% buffer).
- Final transaction summary before broadcast with exact input/output counts, maker fees, and mining fees.
- Support for broadcast confirmation callback to allow user to review transaction before broadcasting.

### Changed

- Fee rate handling improvements:
  - Changed default fee rate from 10 sat/vB to 1 sat/vB fallback.
  - Added support for sub-1 sat/vB fee rates (float instead of int).
  - Added `--block-target` option for fee estimation (1-1008 blocks).
  - Added `--fee-rate` option for manual fee rate (mutually exclusive with `--block-target`).
  - Default behavior: 3-block fee estimation when connected to full node.
  - Neutrino backend: falls back to 1 sat/vB (cannot estimate fees).
  - Error when `--block-target` is used with neutrino backend.
- Backend `estimate_fee()` now returns `float` for precision with sub-sat rates.
- Added `can_estimate_fee()` method to backends for capability detection.
- Increased default counterparty count from 3 to 10 makers.
- Reduced logging verbosity: parsed offers now logged at DEBUG level instead of INFO.

### Fixed

- Critical maker transaction fee calculation bug causing "Change output value too low" errors.
  - Maker `txfee` from offers is the total transaction fee contribution (in satoshis), not per-input/output.
  - Previously incorrectly multiplied `offer.txfee` by `(num_inputs + num_outputs + 1)`, causing maker change calculations to fail.
  - Now correctly uses `offer.txfee` directly as per JoinMarket protocol specification.
- Concurrent read bug in TCPConnection causing "readuntil() called while another coroutine is already waiting" errors.
  - Added receive lock to serialize concurrent `receive()` calls on the same connection.
  - This fixes race conditions when `listen_continuously()` and `get_peerlist_with_features()` run concurrently.
- Wallet address alignment in `jm-wallet info --extended` output.
  - Fixed misalignment when address indices transition from single to double digits (e.g., 9 to 10).
  - Derivation paths now use fixed-width padding (24 characters) for consistent column alignment.
